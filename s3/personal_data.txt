#### PROJECT SECTION

The creator of this project is Aditya Bijapurkar.  
This project was designed, developed, and deployed by Aditya Bijapurkar.  
The owner and maintainer of this project is Aditya Bijapurkar.  

This portfolio system demonstrates Aditya’s backend and frontend expertise.  
It combines multiple services into one integrated platform.  

The project uses a React.js frontend with reusable UI components and CSS-based styling.  
The frontend emphasizes modularity, clean design, and user-friendly navigation.  

The backend is implemented using Java Spring Boot.  
It includes a PostgreSQL database for persistent storage.  
The backend integrates with Google APIs for scheduling Google Meet calls automatically.  
It uses OpenAI APIs through a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework to enhance chatbot interactions.  
The backend applies SOLID principles and design patterns such as the Factory Pattern.  
It includes observability features like distributed tracing, metrics, and logging.  

The system is deployed on AWS cloud infrastructure.  
It uses EC2 for hosting, S3 for storage, SES for sending emails, Route53 for DNS, ACM for SSL certificates, and CloudFront for CDN and DDoS protection.  
Monitoring and alerting are handled by Prometheus and Grafana dashboards.  
The platform is secured using HTTPS and protected with CloudFront’s security features.  

This project also includes a custom email service integrated with AWS SES using a personal domain.  
A CI/CD pipeline using Github Actions is set up so that deployments are automated when code is pushed to the main branch.  

Key features include Google Meet scheduling, spam protection, DDoS defense, automated monitoring, and integration of frontend and backend systems.  

The tech stack used in this project includes React.js for the frontend, 
Spring Boot (Java) for the backend, and PostgreSQL as the database.  

The project uses AWS cloud infrastructure: EC2 for hosting, S3 for storage, SES for email, 
Route53 for DNS, ACM for SSL, and CloudFront for CDN & DDoS protection.  

Additional tools include Docker for containerization, docker-compose for orchestration, 
and GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines.  

For monitoring, the stack includes Prometheus and Grafana.  
Google APIs are integrated for Google Meet scheduling.
